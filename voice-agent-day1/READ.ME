# 30 Days of AI Voice Agents - Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of the *30 Days of AI Voice Agents* challenge!  
This project is part of a 30-day journey to build voice-enabled AI applications using Python, FastAPI/Flask, and frontend technologies.

---

## Project Overview (Day 1)

On Day 1, the main goal was to **set up the basic project structure** with a working backend and a simple frontend.

### Folder Structure

```

app/
templates/
index.html
static/
script.js

````

- **app/** → Python backend code (FastAPI or Flask).  
- **templates/** → HTML files for the frontend.  
- **static/** → Static assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images.  

---

## Day 1: Project Setup

- **Task:** Initialize a Python backend and serve a basic frontend page.  
- **Details:** 
  - Created `index.html` inside `templates` folder.  
  - Added `script.js` inside `static` folder for frontend interactivity.  
  - Configured Python backend to serve HTML page via FastAPI or Flask.  
  - Verified that the page loads successfully in the browser.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/voice-agents-30days.git
cd voice-agents-30days
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment
# Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run the backend server:

```bash
# For FastAPI
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# For Flask
python app.py
```

Open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see the frontend.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* FastAPI or Flask
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is **fully ready to copy and paste** into your GitHub repository.  

If you want, I can **create the same professional template for Day 2** so you can keep adding day-wise progress consistently.  

Do you want me to do that now?
