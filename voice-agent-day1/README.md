Ah! I see what happened — when you copied it to GitHub, the formatting got a bit messed up. The main issues are:

1. Extra backticks in code blocks (` ```` ` instead of ` ``` `).
2. Indentation/spacing in folder structure code block.
3. Some blank lines breaking Markdown sections.

Here’s a **cleaned-up version** that will render correctly on GitHub:

# 30 Days of AI Voice Agents - Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of the *30 Days of AI Voice Agents* challenge!  
This project is part of a 30-day journey to build voice-enabled AI applications using Python, FastAPI/Flask, and frontend technologies.

---

## Project Overview (Day 1)

On Day 1, the main goal was to **set up the basic project structure** with a working backend and a simple frontend.

### Folder Structure

```

app/
templates/
index.html
static/
script.js

````

- **app/** → Python backend code (FastAPI or Flask)  
- **templates/** → HTML files for the frontend  
- **static/** → Static assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images  

---

## Day 1: Project Setup

- **Task:** Initialize a Python backend and serve a basic frontend page  
- **Details:** 
  - Created `index.html` inside `templates` folder  
  - Added `script.js` inside `static` folder for frontend interactivity  
  - Configured Python backend to serve HTML page via FastAPI or Flask  
  - Verified that the page loads successfully in the browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/voice-agents-30days.git
cd voice-agents-30days
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run the backend server:

```bash
# For FastAPI
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# For Flask
python app.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to view the frontend.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* FastAPI or Flask
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Jinja2 Templates

---

## Next Steps

* Day 2 will focus on adding **voice input capabilities** to the agent and integrating basic AI responses

✅ This version will display correctly on GitHub with proper code blocks, headings, and spacing.  

If you want, I can also **make it even more visually engaging** with emojis and badges so your Day 1 README stands out. Do you want me to do that?
