# 30 Days of AI Voice Agents | Day 27: Revamp UI and Code Cleanup

## Overview
Day 27 focuses on **revamping the UI** and performing **code cleanup** to make the voice agent more user-friendly, maintainable, and visually appealing. Additionally, a configuration section is added to allow the user to input their **API keys** directly through the UI.

## Features
- **API Key Configuration**: Users can enter API keys for services like AssemblyAI, Gemini, and Murf directly in the UI.
- **UI Revamp**: Modernized interface with improved layout, buttons, and visual feedback.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports, variables, and functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clearer interface, better button placement, and overall polished design.
- **Optional New Features**: Add small enhancements or visual improvements as desired.

## How It Works
1. **API Key Input**: 
   - A sidebar or dialog box allows users to input API keys.
   - These keys are used for all subsequent interactions with the voice agent.
2. **UI Enhancements**: 
   - Record and stop buttons can be combined with a status indicator.
   - Audio playback and chat history display can be cleaned and styled.
   - Animations and visual feedback improve user engagement.
3. **Code Cleanup**: 
   - Organize the project structure.
   - Remove unnecessary code or comments.
   - Modularize code for better maintainability.

## Usage
1. Open the revamped UI in your browser.
2. Enter your API keys in the configuration section.
3. Interact with the voice agent:
   - Record your voice
   - Receive transcriptions
   - Get LLM responses
   - Listen to Murf-generated audio
4. Enjoy a cleaner, more polished interface and smoother functionality.

## Notes
- User-provided API keys override `.env` keys for flexibility.
- Ensure valid keys are entered to avoid connection errors.
- This revamp improves both **frontend usability** and **backend maintainability**.
