# Day 23: Complete Voice Agent

Welcome to Day 23 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge! Today, we've completed the full integration of all components to create a **complete conversational voice agent**. The agent can handle user queries, transcribe them, send them to the LLM API, generate responses, save chat history, send responses to Murf AI, and stream audio to the client.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  * **Complete Voice Agent**: Full integration of all components including speech-to-text, LLM processing, text-to-speech, and audio streaming.
  * **Real-Time Transcription**: Uses AssemblyAI for accurate speech-to-text conversion with turn detection.
  * **Intelligent Responses**: Powered by Google Gemini LLM for context-aware conversational responses.
  * **High-Quality Voice Synthesis**: Murf AI integration for natural-sounding text-to-speech conversion.
  * **WebSocket Streaming**: Real-time audio streaming between client and server for seamless conversations.
  * **Session Management**: Maintains chat history for context-aware conversations across multiple turns.
  * **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback audio responses.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack has been enhanced to support real-time, streaming Text-to-Speech.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, `google-generativeai` (with streaming), `python-dotenv`, `websockets`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript`, `MediaRecorder` API, `WebSocket API`
  * **AI APIs**:
      * **Murf AI (Streaming Text-to-Speech via WebSockets)**
      * AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)
      * Google Gemini (Streaming Large Language Model)

## ðŸš€ Run the App

1.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set up your API keys:**
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
    - Add your actual API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_actual_murf_api_key"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_actual_assemblyai_api_key"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_gemini_api_key"
    ```

3.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

4.  **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:8000`

5.  **Grant microphone permissions** when prompted to enable voice recording

6.  **Start conversing** with the voice agent by clicking the microphone button and speaking
