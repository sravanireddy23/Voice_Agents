# 30 Days of AI Voice Agents | Day 12: Revamping the UI

## Overview
Day 12 focuses on **revamping the UI** of your AI Voice Agent. The goal is to make the conversational agent interface more user-friendly, visually appealing, and interactive, while keeping the core functionality intact. The previous text-to-speech and echo bot sections are removed to streamline the UI.

## Features
- **Single Record Button**: Combines "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording" into one button that dynamically changes based on the current recording state.
- **Automatic Audio Playback**: The agent's response audio plays automatically when ready; the audio player can be hidden.
- **Enhanced Styling**: 
  - More prominent record button
  - Optional animations or visual feedback when recording
  - Cleaner layout focused on conversation
- **Core Functionality Maintained**: Recording, STT transcription, LLM response, Murf TTS, and playback all continue to work seamlessly.

## How It Works
1. The user clicks the **Record** button to start recording.
2. The button changes state (color, text, or animation) to indicate recording is in progress.
3. When recording stops, audio is sent to the server for transcription and LLM processing.
4. The LLM response is converted to Murf TTS audio and played back automatically.
5. The button resets to allow a new recording.

## Usage
1. Open the updated UI in a browser.
2. Click the **Record** button to start interacting with the conversational agent.
3. Observe the improved visual feedback and styling while interacting with the bot.

## Notes
- The UI revamp focuses on **usability and aesthetics**, not backend changes.
- Animations and visual cues enhance user experience.
- Core functionalities (voice recording, LLM, TTS playback) remain unchanged.
